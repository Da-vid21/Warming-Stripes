### Introduction

Global warming has caused a great deal of damage to our planet, but the most astounding aspect is that it is still having an impact. 

This project was intended to inform those who do not believe that global warming is hurting the Earth and its inhabitants, and that there is no need to be concerned.

### Why did we choose this topic?
Climate change has been occurring for decades, and while the rate of change is gradual, it is nonetheless consistent. Global warming impacts everyone and everything on the planet, and many species will be unable to adapt as a result of fast temperature changes and natural calamities, leading to widespread extinction.

### What does this numbers mean?

In this project, we used csv files containing climate change data going back over 100 years to produce a bar graph and a warming stipe to show the consequences of global warming over this period of time. These numbers serve as a way of telling the audience that climate change is serious and needs our attention.

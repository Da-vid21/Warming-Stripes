### Introduction

Climate change threatens our agriculture, health, water supply, infrastructure and more. Whether it comes in the form of more powerful storms and floods, intense heat waves, deadly wildfires, devastating droughts, or crop disruption and food shortages, those from economically disadvantaged communities, tribal communities, and communities of color suffer the most from centuries of investment in fossil fuel infrastructure. 

The most worrisome aspect, however, is that it's only going to get worse. Climate change is widespread, rapid, and intensifying. 

What's more, a fairly large number of people — 82.5 million in the United States alone — either are unsure of or don't believe in climate change.

That's why the premise for our hack is to help these numbers come alive by visualizing what we're seeing and pairing the qualitative and quantitative to make our case.

### Why did we choose this topic?

Climate change has been occurring for decades, and while the rate of change is gradual, it is nonetheless consistent. Global warming impacts everyone and everything on the planet, and many species will be unable to adapt as a result of fast temperature changes and natural calamities, leading to widespread extinction.

### What do the numbers mean?

We created a warming stripes as well as a bar graph using csv files containing climate change data from several areas. These graphs depict how climate change has impacted the planet over the last 200 years in greater detail. And if it wasn't enough this also serves as a means of educating people about the seriousness of climate change.

### How we used Github

We collaborated on code using Github, and Github acted as a command center whereby each team member create their own branch and delegated someone to approve all changes and ensure that the code pushed to the branch doesn't crash the main code. 

We also delegated tasks via Github and used branches as a form of tracking where team members were at and what tasks needed completing. 

When we had trouble with a feature in our own branch, we would push to branch and have fellow team members review the branch, push changes to get through the kinks, and then resumed working on the branch. Together, we had 55+ commits, which doesn't even count the commits within branches.

### 🧐 Visualizations

Starting with warming stripes, this appeared on social media on Jun 21 last year. Known for being a visualization of global warming from 1880 to 2020 with each stripe representing one year and each color a temperature value, one look at the graphic tells a story: the world has become much hotter, and it has done so very recently.
